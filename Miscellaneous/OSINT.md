# OSINT
In terms of information that can be gathered from third parties the following sources may be available as a starting point:  
 

*   Information on the services active on a node can be acquired with tools like Shodan.
*   Additional resources may be found using search engines and advanced tags like :site, :filetype or :title.  
     
*   Subdomains and related IP addresses may be found using online scanners or tools like `recon-ng`; a poorly chosen subdomain may also reveal information about the target even if it is protected behind a firewall.  
     
*   ASN and WHOIS queries may reveal what provider is responsible for hosting the site.

Information may also be gathered from the target site and related assets if they are publicly available including:

*   The technologies used to host the site may be acquired from error pages, file extensions, debug pages, or the server tag used in an HTTP response
*   Additional information on the tools used by the target may be available in job listings
