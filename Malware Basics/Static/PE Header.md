# PE Header
The PE File Header contains the metadata about a Portable Executable file. This data can help us find a lot of helpful information to help us in our analysis

if a developer wants to Query a Windows Registry value, they will import the [RegQueryValue](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winreg/nf-winreg-regqueryvaluew) function provided by Microsoft instead of writing the code themselves.

Names of Windows APIs are generally intuitive and self-explanatory. However, we can always consult [Microsoft Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/_winprog/)Â to verify the purpose of a particular Windows function.

Although the sections in a PE file depend on the compiler or packer used to compile or pack the binary, the following are the most commonly seen sections in a PE file.

*   .**text:** This Section generally contains the CPU instructions executed when the PE file is run. This section is marked as executable.
*   **.data:** This Section contains the global variables and other global data used by the PE file.
*   **.rsrc:** This Section contains resources that are used by the PE file, for example, images, icons, etc.
