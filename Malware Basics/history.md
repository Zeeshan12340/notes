**Astaroth**. A fileless malware means that the malware runs and is executed in the system without writing to disk. The malware performs all its functions from the victim device's memory.

In the initial access stage, attackers rely on a spam campaign that contains malicious attachment files. The attached file is an LNK file shortcut that, once the victim has clicked it, will result in the following:

*   A **WMIC** command is executed to download and run Javascript code.
*   Abusing the **BITSadmin** to download multiple binaries from the command and control server. Interestingly, in some cases, the malware uses YouTube channel descriptions to hide their C2 server commands.
*   Using the BITSadmin, ADS technique, to hide their binaries within the system for their persistence.
*   A **Certutil** tool is used to decode a couple of downloaded payloads into DLL files.
*   The DLL files are executed using **Regsvr32**.
