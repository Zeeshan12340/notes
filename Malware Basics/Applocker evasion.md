# Applocker evasion
If AppLocker is configured with default AppLocker rules, we can bypass it by placing our executable in the following directory: `C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\color` \- This is whitelisted by default.

Just like Linux bash, Windows powershell saves all previous commands into a file called **ConsoleHost\_history**. This is located at %userprofile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\PSReadline\\ConsoleHost\_history.txt
