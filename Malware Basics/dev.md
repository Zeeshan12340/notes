normally nc is known by windows defender and is blocked by it, but we can pull the source code and modify it to evade detection by defender.

we get the C source code from here, [https://github.com/zhaili/netcat](https://github.com/zhaili/netcat) and modify some strings/comments and variable names and re-compile the code in Microsoft Visual Studio(clone the repo directly in Visual Studio). After compiling, nc.exe is not detected by our defender but connection on the remote machine is not established. We change the "mode" from debug to release and re-compile and the `nc.exe` binary establishes a reverse shell.

The `-e` option which is needed for revshell is called a “Gaping\_Security\_Hole” in the netcat source code, after changing it's name and such, it's not detected by defender.
