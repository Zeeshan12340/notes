The **U** ser **D**atagram **P** rotocol (**UDP**) is another protocol that is used to communicate data between devices.

Unlike its brother TCP, UDP is a **stateless**  protocol that doesn't require a constant connection between the two devices for data to be sent. For example, the Three-way handshake does not occur, nor is there any synchronisation between the two devices.
