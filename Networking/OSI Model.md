# OSI Model
**OSI Model**
-------------

The **OSI** model (or **O**pen **S**ystems **I**nterconnection Model) is an absolute fundamental model used in networking.Â  This critical model provides a framework dictating how all networked devices will send, receive and interpret data.

One of the main benefits of the OSI model is that devices can have different functions and designs on a network while communicating with other devices. Data sent across a network that follows the uniformity of the OSI model can be understood by other devices.

There are seven layers which are shown below:

Important Questions:
--------------------

What is the key term for when pieces of information get added to data? (encapsulation)

What is the technical term that is given to the name of the software that users interact with?(GUI)

What is the main purpose that this presentation Layer acts as?(Translator)

What is the technical term for when a connection is successfully established?(session)

What type of addresses are dealt with at this network layer?(IP addresses)

What is the name of the piece of hardware that all networked devices come with(data link)?(Network interface card)

TCP vs UDP:
-----------

The **T**ransmission **C**ontrol **P**rotocol (**TCP**). Potentially hinted by the name, this protocol is designed with reliability and guarantee in mind. This protocol reserves a constant connection between the two devices for the amount of time it takes for the data to be sent and received.

Not only this, but TCP incorporates error checking into its design. Error checking is how TCP can guarantee that data sent from the small chunks in the session layer (layer 5) has then been received and reassembled in the same order.

The third layer of the OSI model (network layer) is where the magic of routing & re-assembly of data takes place (from these small chunks to the larger chunk). Firstly, routing simply determines the most optimal path in which these chunks of data should be sent.

Network layer:
--------------

Whilst some protocols at this layer determine exactly what is the "optimal" path that data should take to reach a device, we should only know about their existence at this stage of the networking module. Briefly, these protocols include **OSPF** (**O**pen **S**hortest **P**ath **F**irst) and **RIP** (**R**outing **I**nformation **P**rotocol).The third layer of the OSI model (network layer) is where the magic of routing & re-assembly of data takes place (from these small chunks to the larger chunk).
