# Notes

When I started learning about cybersecurity, I was told to take good notes on everything from youtube videos to CTFs and even those boring long tool manuals. I tried using Obsidian but at the time I didn't want to have to learn markdown just to take *somewhat good* notes so I chose [trilium notes](https://github.com/zadam/trilium). Gradually took notes on a lot of different stuff before completely stopping because I didn't feel like it anymore. I still reference these from time to time and the're are still very helpful to me so I decided to make them public (this also makes it easier for me to reference them).

## Importing

If you want to see these in full glory, you can import them into trilium notes. I've included an exported file `root.zip`.
