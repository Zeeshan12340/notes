# Tricks
_Side note : I was able to get a shell with these simple shell codes but only by using another method : an env variable. With this method you don't put your shell code in the buffer but in an environment variable and then you give the return address the address of that variable. That way you don't mess up the memory and I didn't get any error._

It's made the same mistake that many people make manually when hunting for bad chars -- it's failed to factor in that a single bad character may corrupt more than just itself

Specifically, each bad character has also corrupted the character immediately after itself -- the correct answer is \\x00\\x07\\x2e\\xa0

If you did it manually you would see that each bad character has been replaced with \\x0a\\x0d -- or `\n\r` in ASCII. A line break, in other words. The effect of the bad characters (in this particular instance -- remember that these are engineered) is that they cause a line break. Line breaks on Windows take two characters, so the next character is also corrupted.

Mona simply doesn't take that into account
