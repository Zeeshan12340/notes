Â Metatron1x Notes
-----------------

so anything that starts with 7f/f7 is likely to be something from libc

the ones that start with 5 could be a base address

and the long strings that arent any of those things could be the canary

so for canary what you do is fire up gdb and step through giving the input values for each of the possible candidates and then looking at the register when it sets it to i believe $rax

you can also verify it on the stack by looking at x/20gx $rsp

if you want to test canary you can see 13, 21, 26, 27 are possible candidates

so you would send %13$lx as your input and step through and see if the value matches what it sets as the canary, running `vmmap` after the input and seeing if the first address matches the leaked address

or as you `ni` it will just point one line at a time

you just know that its done with the mov when its on the next line

the top address in `disass get_streak` shows the offset from the base then

```text-plain
ropper --file ./pwn110.pwn110 --chain "execve cmd=/bin/sh"
```

Finding the stack canary
------------------------

run the binary in gdb, and enter `%13$lx` (`l` for long and x for hex), 13 is the instruction number found from `leak.py`.

this should output(a) an address,which might be the canary's address.

ctrl+c the execution and run through the instructions with `ni` (next instruction) checking rax value with `p $rax` if rax value matches with the output(a), then that is your stack canary.
