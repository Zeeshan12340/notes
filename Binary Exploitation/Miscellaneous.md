# Miscellaneous
nothing gets deleted from the stack by the prologue or epilogue. When the next stack frame is made it will be put right where the old one was and there will still be data there. This is why you should initialize variables upfront, because otherwise, your variable may contain garbage from the previous function/stack frame.

Depends on the implementation of the program you're sending it to. \\r\\n are a carriage return and linefeed respectively -- combined they represent a newline in Windows. \*nix systems just use \\n. Old Macs used \\r alone but now use \\n like the rest of the sane world.

It's basically just telling the program that the line ends here, which, for some programs, is how they denote the end of the expected buffer
