`LDC 0` loads ‘0’ on the top of stack, `LDC 3` pushes ‘3’ to the top of stack,

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| swap | 5f  | 0101 1111 |     | value2, value1 → value1, value2 | swaps two top words on the stack (note that value1 and value2 must not be double or long) |

|     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| pop | 57  | 0101 0111 |     | value → | discard the top value on the stack |

| ineg | 74  | 0111 0100 |     | value → result | negate int |

| lxor | 83  | 1000 0011 |     | value1, value2 → result | bitwise XOR of two longs |
