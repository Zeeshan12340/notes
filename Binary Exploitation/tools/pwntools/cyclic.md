# cyclic
An important part of the memory we can overwrite is the instruction pointer (IP), which is called the eip on 32-bit machines, and rip on 64-bit machines. The IP points to the next instruction to be executed, so if we redirect the eip in our binary to the print\_flag() function, we can print the flag.

first, use a high value such as `cyclic(300)` and then see the value written in eip/rip, then use that value in `cyclic(cyclic_find('jaaa'))` Â 

Use `p32(0x08048536)` to convert function addresses to bytes(use `p64()` for 64 bit binaries)
