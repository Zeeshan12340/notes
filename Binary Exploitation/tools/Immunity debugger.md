# Immunity debugger
**Mona Configuration**
----------------------

The mona script has been preinstalled, however to make it easier to work with, you should configure a working folder using the following command, which you can run in the command input box at the bottom of the Immunity Debugger window:

```text-plain
!mona config -set workingfolder c:\mona\%p
!mona findmsp -distance 2000
```

**Finding Bad Characters**
--------------------------

ï»¿Generate a bytearray using mona, and exclude the null byte (\\x00) by default. Note the location of the bytearray.bin file that is generated (if the working folder was set per the Mona Configuration section of this guide, then the location should be C:\\mona\\oscp\\bytearray.bin).

`!mona bytearray -b "\x00"`

Make a note of the address to which the ESP register points and use it in the following mona command:

`!mona compare -f C:\mona\oscp\bytearray.bin -a <address>,`compare bad chars one by one

**Finding a Jump Point**
------------------------

With the oscp.exe either running or in a crashed state, run the following mona command, making sure to update the -cpb option with all the badchars you identified (including \\x00):

`!mona jmp -r esp -cpb "\x00"`
