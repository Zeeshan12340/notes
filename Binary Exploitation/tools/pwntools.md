# pwntools
```text-plain
checksec intro2pwn1
```

to use stdin, stdout with pwntools, we can use:

```text-plain
io = process('/challenge/embryoio_level19',  stdin=open('/tmp/ldgqeo', 'r'))
```

The command line command for shellcraft is: `shellcraft arch.OS.command`, such as:

```text-plain
pwn shellcraft -f d amd64.linux.setreuid 1003

shellcraft i386.linux.sh
shellcraft i386.linux.execve "/bin///sh" "['sh', '-p']" -f a
```

`-f d` sets the format to "escaped". You can set `-f a` to look at the assembly version

_Side note: It would also work if you don't specify the UID 1002 . It would automatically grab the effective UID with geteuid() and set it as your Real UID. But I keep it that way to make things clearer._

use [https://libc.blukat.me](https://libc.blukat.me) to find matching libc with leaked addresses

_To use an ssh id\_rsa with pwntools, we can do:_

```text-plain
shell = ssh('minos', '10.10.66.140',keyfile='./id_rsa', port=22)
```

_use_ `_proc = process('./intro2pwnFinal')_` to start the binary as a process and use `proc.recvline()` and `proc.send(payload)` to recieve text and send payload respectively.

Finally, after we have sent the payload, we need a way to communicate with the shell we have just spawned. We can do with with 

`proc.interactive()`
