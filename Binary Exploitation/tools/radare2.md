# radare2
```text-plain
r2 -d <filename>
aaa \\analyze all flags afl \\lists all functions

e asm.syntax=att \\switch to AT&T syntax instead of intel syntax

pdf @main \\print disassembly function

movq $3 rax \\It would move the constant 3 to the register

izz \\prints all strings info strings iA iM ie

s prints current memory address s+ 12 s- 5  sr rax

Find clear text password with izz
set breakpoint with db at compare statement(strcmp or cmp), use dc to run unitl breakpoint and px @rsi(or other memory location(not sure yet!))

also, check value with pdf @main of cmp location,  cmp eax, 0x137c  0x137c is the password

set breakpoints at jle and mov dword

px @rbp-0x24
```

In radare you can use the `dr` command (it stands for debug registers) to inspect the value of every register at any given point during the execution.

If you reach your breakpoint and `dr` prints `rax` as 0x0, it is because `rax`'s value is indeed 0 at that that point. _Take into account that rax is usually used for return values when quitting functions_

Besides, you could also use the `?` operator in r2 to get the result of the operation. For instance, `? [rbp + rax - 0x16]` should print the result
