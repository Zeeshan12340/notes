# PIE Leak
PIE is position independent executable, basically when you run the binary the function addresses are randomized and you need to leak a base address and find it's offset to be able to find the correct function addresses(or just re-base your elf with elf.address)

First, to leak an address we need some type of vulnerability like format string where we just give `%p` to the binary and it prints out stack addresses, chain together a bunch of them like `%p-%p-%p-%p-%p-%p-%p` and see if it resembles addresses like `0x5662b3cf` which is your base address.

Now, move over to GDB and run the binary again(preferably with a break-point at the “second gets address”) and get your base address `%3$p` out( the break-point should kick in after this point or you can just pause the execution with CTRL+C if you can).

Running `vmmap` you should see this:

here, the first address we see `0x5660e000` is the address we want, just subtracting the original leaked address with this one, we get out offset

In gdb using : `p 0x5660f3cf - 0x5660e000`
