# Container environment 
Containers, due to their isolated nature, will often have very little processes running in comparison to something such as a virtual machine. We can simply use `ps aux` to print the running processes.

Containers allow environment variables to be provided from the host operating system by the use of a ".dockerenv" file. This file is located in the "/" directory, and would exist on a container - even if no environment variables were provided: `cd / && ls -lah`

Those pesky cgroups

Note how we utilised "cgroups" in Task 10. Cgroups are used by containerisation software such as LXC or Docker. Let's look for them with by navigating to "/proc/1" and then _catting_Â  the "cgroups" file...It is worth mentioning that the "cgroups" file contains paths including the word "docker"
